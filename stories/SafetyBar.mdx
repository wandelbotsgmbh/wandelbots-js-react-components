# Safety Bar

The `SafetyBar` component provides a visual representation of the current safety state, operation mode, and controller type of a robot or motion group. It combines three indicators into a single bar:

- Safety State Indicator
- Operation Mode Indicator
- Controller Type Indicator

## Usage

```tsx
<SafetyBar
  isVirtual={false}
  motionGroupId="robot1"
  operationMode="OPERATION_MODE_AUTO"
  safetyState="SAFETY_STATE_NORMAL"
/>
```

## Examples

### Default Configuration
A physical robot in automatic mode with normal safety state.

<Story of={SafetyBarStories.Default} />

### Virtual Robot
Shows the indicator for a virtual robot, which has different safety implications.

<Story of={SafetyBarStories.VirtualRobot} />

### Manual Operation Mode
Indicates when the robot is in manual operation mode, requiring additional safety precautions.

<Story of={SafetyBarStories.ManualMode} />

### Emergency Stop
Shows the state when an emergency stop has been triggered.

<Story of={SafetyBarStories.EmergencyStop} />

### Protective Stop
Displays the indicator when the robot is in a protective stop state.

<Story of={SafetyBarStories.ProtectiveStop} />

### Error State
Shows how the safety bar appears when the robot is in an error state.
