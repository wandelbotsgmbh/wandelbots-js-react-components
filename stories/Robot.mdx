# Robot


This `Robot` component adds the robot to the 3D viewport. Use it together with the `connectedMotionGroup` from `@wandelbots/wandelbots-js`.

```tsx
<Robot connectedMotionGroup={connectedMotionGroup} />
```

The robot model are loaded from the [jsdelivr CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wandelbotsgmbh/wandelbots-js-react-components/public/models/).

In case you want to use the application offline, you can download the models and host them locally. You can override the URL resolver of the `Robot` component by passing a `getModel` function like:

```tsx
<Robot
  getModel={() => `public/${connectedMotionGroup.modelFromController}.glb`}
  connectedMotionGroup={connectedMotionGroup}
/>
```
