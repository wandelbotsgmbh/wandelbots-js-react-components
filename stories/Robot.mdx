# Robot


This `Robot` component adds the robot to the 3D viewport. Use it together with the `ConnectedMotionGroup` from this library:

```tsx
import { NovaClient } from "@wandelbots/nova-js/v2"
import { ConnectedMotionGroup } from "@wandelbots/wandelbots-js-react-components/core"
import { Robot } from "@wandelbots/wandelbots-js-react-components/3d"

const nova = new NovaClient({ instanceUrl: "https://your-nova-instance.com" })
const connectedMotionGroup = await ConnectedMotionGroup.connect(nova, "0@your-motion-group-id");

<Robot connectedMotionGroup={connectedMotionGroup} />
```

The robot model are loaded from your connected Nova instance.

```tsx
const file = await nova.api.motionGroupModels.getMotionGroupGlbModel(modelFromController)
const url = URL.createObjectURL(file)
return url
```


In case you want to use the application offline, you can download the models and host them locally. You can override the URL resolver of the `Robot` component by passing a `getModel` function like:

```tsx
<Robot
  getModel={() => `public/${connectedMotionGroup.modelFromController}.glb`}
  connectedMotionGroup={connectedMotionGroup}
/>
```
