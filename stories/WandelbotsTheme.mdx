# Wandelbots MUI Theme

The component library comes with a Wandelbots theme for Material UI which is the default theme used in this storybook. 
If you like, you can use it in your own app to give the components a similar look.
The theme is accessed by calling `createNovaMuiTheme`, and can be [customized](?path=/docs/theming-theming-components--docs) as needed.

The theme comes in dark and light variants using the standard MUI [`palette.mode` option](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/). 

<Source dark={true} code={`
import { ThemeProvider } from "@mui/material"
import { createNovaMuiTheme } from "@wandelbots/wandelbots-js-react-components"

const theme = createNovaMuiTheme()

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  ...
</ThemeProvider>
`}/>

<Canvas of={ThemeStories.muiComponents} sourceState="none" />
