# Jogging Panel


The `JoggingPanel` is a high-level user interface for manually moving a robot using the Wandelbots stack. It needs only a `NovaClient` instance from [nova-js](https://github.com/wandelbotsgmbh/nova-js) and the id of a motion group to connect to.
It can be used to quickly create a jogging panel to control a robot.

```tsx
<JoggingPanel
  nova={wandelApp.nova}
  motionGroupId={connectedMotionGroup.motionGroupId}
/>
```
